# reactNativeStarter
Super simple RN starter boilerplate, uses Mobx and React Navigation


Clone and cd into repo</br>
```yarn```</br>
change the name of the project to whatever you like </br>
```react-native-rename <newName>```</br>
this does not change the name of the root file itself, you wil need to do that manually</br> 
then </br>
```react-native run-ios``` or ```react-native run-android```
